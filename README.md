# SinnerCast

website for my online radio, SinnerCast Radio. My first project on here so no idea how all of this works.

im mainly using this to centralize my files and just cuz i never had a git before.

My vision is mainly directed towards a mostly mobile experience. So far ive been goin in the direction of a material design theme thinking maybe some bootstrap or sometthing so i can lern more abou it but havent messed with that much so im still learning there. I have a habit of changing things alot so i need to make something that is easily customizable. Im thinking a dark theme with bright acceents. Lets see how it goes.

To Do:
- static player

  i need to include a persistent music player so if the user navigates the site the music wont restart.
  I could achieve this with tabs if i must, I also toyed with the idea of frames or iframes not sure the direction i want to   go yet and its likely to change a few times before the end.
other features:
- chat
- requests module
- dj accounts / profiles
- user accounts / profiles
- radio history
- DJ schedule

There's more things to do but ill add them as i go.
Eventually im going to turn this into an app/web app and it would be cool for the djs to be able to stream directly from the app. there are a few streaming apps available i just have to learn how to intigrate them.
